### RabbitMQ Chart

RabbitMQ is an open source general-purpose message broker that is designed  for consistent, highly-available messaging scenarios (both synchronous and asynchronous).

NOTE: Because of the bitnami public repo deprecation, some of the default images in `default-values.yaml` were changed from `bitnami` to `bitnamilegacy`. The lifespan and availability of the public repo means this is only for testing and development environments.

See the [upstream github repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) has more information.
